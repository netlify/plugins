# Netlify Build Plugins

[Build Plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins) are a new way to extend the functionality of your build on Netlify. The [`plugins.json` file](./site/plugins.json) in this repository is used to generate the [Netlify plugins directory](https://app.netlify.com/plugins). Plugins in this directory can be installed directly through the Netlify UI.

## Contributing

The Netlify plugins directory is filled with plugins created by Netlify staff and members of the community like you. You can contribute to the directory in the following ways:

- [Add a plugin](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-plugin) you've written to the plugins directory.
- [Update a plugin](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#update-a-plugin) you maintain that's already in the directory.
- [Request directory deactivation](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#request-deactivation) for a plugin which is not being maintained.

Visit the repository [contributor guide](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
